# JavaScript Basics

<a name="JavaScript-Basics"></a>

## Learning Objectives

- Connect a JavaScript file with `<script>`
- Log to the console
- Select elements with `querySelector`
- Add, remove and toggle CSS classes on `click` with `addEventListener`

---

<a name="Connect-a-JavaScript-file"></a>

## Connect a JavaScript file

<details>
```html
<head>
  ...
  <script src="./index.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  ...
</body>
```

The `script` tag has two attributes:

`src="./index.js"` sets the URL to our JavaScript file

`defer` tells the browser to delay the loading of the script until all HTML elements are loaded.

> 💡 Alternative: `script` tag at the end of the body element, so `defer` attribute is not
> necessary. Less modern.

```html
<head>
  ...
</head>
<body>
  ...
  <script src="./index.js"></script>
</body>
```

</details>

<a name="Log-to-the-console"></a>

## Hello World: `console.log()`

<details>
In Javascript we can print text to the console of the web browser. We can use this for debugging or
error logging for example.

```js
console.log("Hello World!"); // logs into console
console.clear(); // clears console
console.error("Error!"); // logs as error into console
```

</details>

##### Challenge `console.log()`

<a name="Selecting-HTML-Elements-querySelector"></a>

## Selecting HTML Elements: `.querySelector()`

<details>
Before we can add interactivity, we need to select the necessary HTML-Elements:

```html
<body>
  <main class="main" id="main" data-js="main">...</main>
</body>
```

There are multiple ways to select the above main section within our JavaScript. A good practice is
to use a
[data-\* attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*),
like the **data-js** in the following example:

```js
const mainElement = document.querySelector('[data-js="main"]');
```

Other css selectors work as well, but the data-\* attribute selectors should be preferred.

```js
// tag as identifier
const mainElement = document.querySelector("main");
// class as identifier -> .
const mainElement = document.querySelector(".main");
// id as identifier -> #
const mainElement = document.querySelector("#main");
```

> 💡 We try to separate our concerns: Classes are for CSS and data-\* attributes are for JavaScript

</details>

<a name="Add-Interaction-addEventListener"></a>

## Add Interaction: `.addEventListener()`

<details>
We can listen to **events** like **clicks** on an Element and execute code when the event is
triggered. The method `addEventListener` is used to react to events.

```html
<button type="button" data-js="button">Log into console</button>
```

```js
const button = document.querySelector('[data-js="button"]');
button.addEventListener("click", () => {});
```

First you specify the kind of event, e.g. **click**, then you define what code should be executed
when the event is triggered. You write that code between the `{}` brackets, e.g. a `console.log`.

```js
const button = document.querySelector('[data-js="button"]');
button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Yeah");
});
```

There different events you can listen to, for example:

```js
button.addEventListener("mouseover", () => {});
```

```js
button.addEventListener("keydown", () => {});
```

> 💡 Here you can find a
> [list of event types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events#event_listing).
> 💡 You don't have to understand the syntax for now, we will cover this in a later session.

</details>

<a name="Add-remove-toggle-classes-classList"></a>

## Add/remove & toggle classes: `.classList.`

<details>
You can add, remove and toggle classes, e.g. to change the styling of an element.

```html
<main data-js="main">
  <button type="button" data-js="button">Add a class</button>
</main>
```

Add **page--primary** class to the above main section by using the `selectedElement.classList.add`
method:

```js
const main = document.querySelector('[data-js="main"]');
const button = document.querySelector('[data-js="button"]');
button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  main.classList.add("page--primary");
});
```

A click on the button adds the class **page--primary** to the main element:

```html
<main data-js="main" class="page--primary">
  <button type="button" data-js="button">Add a class</button>
</main>
```

You can also remove or toggle a class in the same way:

```js
main.classList.remove("page--primary");
```

```js
main.classList.toggle("page--primary");
```

# JS Variables and Numbers

## Learning Objectives

- knowing the difference between `var`, `let` and `const`
- understanding the different data types
- using basic math operations

---

<a name="Variable-Declarations"></a>

## Variable Declarations

<details>
Variables are a `reference` or `alias` for data stored in memory. You can access this data by using
this variable. You can use three different keywords to declare a variable:

- `const` - declares a constant, the value can't be changed. Default way to declare variables.
- `let` - declares a variable, the value can be changed. Only used when reassigning a new value is
  necessary.
- `var` - outdated, not used anymore.

Normally the keyword `const` is used to declare a variable.

```js
const aNewVariable = 1234;
```

The keyword `let` is only used when you need to reassign a value, for example when you want to
increase a counter.

```js
let counter = 0;
counter = counter + 1; // reassigning the value of counter
```

The `=` sign in programming doesn't quite work like the mathematical equality that you (maybe)
remember from school. It means: "the value of the item on the right of the equal sign is saved in
the item on the left of it". What the item on the right actually represents is calculated first and
saved afterwards.

</details>

<a name="Primitive-Data-Types"></a>

## Primitive Data Types

<details>
Javascript is a dynamically typed language, which means, that you don't have to specify what kind of
value you want to store, JavaScript detects this automatically.

There are 7 primitive data types:

| type        | represents                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string`    | a sequence of characters: "abcd"                                                                                            |
| `number`    | a number: 1234                                                                                                              |
| `boolean`   | a binary statement, can be `true` or `false`                                                                                |
| `null`      | represents "nothing", is typically set by developers                                                                        |
| `undefined` | represents the state of "not existing". Anything not specified or not found in JavaScript defaults to the value `undefined` |
| `BigInt`    | uncommon, used for integers larger than 9007199254740991                                                                    |
| `Symbol`    | uncommon, used for creating unique elements                                                                                 |

</details>

<a name="Variable-Naming"></a>

## Variable Naming

<details>
Expressive variable names are very important for the `readability of the code`. The Code becomes
easier to understand and needs less comments. There are some key guidelines you should follow when
naming a variable:

- use camel case: `socialFeedEntry` instead of `socialfeedentry`
- write out all words: `error` instead of `e`, `followerButton` instead of `flBtn`
- be very specific, longer names are better than shorter: `updatedFollowerCounter` instead of
`counter`.
</details>

<a name="Math_and_Operators"></a>

## Math & Operators

<details>
As a programmer you sometimes have to use mathematical operations to calculate certain widths or
positions of elements. Operators calculate values based on one or two expressions.

| operator | precedence | effect                                                                                       |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+`      | 11         | adds two numbers together.                                                                   |
| `-`      | 11         | subtracts two numbers                                                                        |
| `*`      | 12         | multiplies two numbers                                                                       |
| `/`      | 12         | divides two numbers                                                                          |
| `**`     | 13         | potentiates two numbers: `2 ** 4 → 16`                                                       |
| `%`      | 12         | The remainder or modulus. Gives you what remains after a whole number division: `8 % 3 → 2`. |

The remainder is a very useful operator, but might be difficult to understand at first. A real life
example would be time on a clock. After noon, you don't reach 13am but you start over at 1pm. 3
hours after midnight you don't have 15pm (or 27h in the 24h format), but 3am. It is whatever hour we
have mod 12.

You can use this operator to determine if a number is even or odd:

```js
6 % 2 === 0;
```

This is always true for even numbers, because after dividing an even number by 2 nothing remains.

```js
5 % 2 === 1;
```

This is also true for all odd numbers, because after this division you have always 1 left over.

</details>

<a name="Operator-Precedence"></a>

## Operator Precedence

<details>
In maths, some operators have a higher precedence than others. This means that they are performed
before operators with a lower precedence. For example, multiplication comes before addition. You can
look up the precedence of the operators in the table above.
</details>

<a name="Assignment-Operators"></a>

## Assignment Operators

<details>
You already know the default assignment operator `=`. This operator just assigns the value on the
right to the element on the left. There are more assignment operators for very common actions like
increasing a variable by a fixed value.

| operator | effect                                                                                                                |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+=`     | Increases the value of the variable on the left about the value on the right: `count += 6` → count is increased by 6. |
| `-=`     | Decreases the value of the variable on the left about the value on the right.                                         |
| `*=`     | Multiplies the variable on the left with the value on the right.                                                      |
| `/=`     | Divides the variable on the left with the value on the right.                                                         |
| `++`     | Increments the value of a variable by one: `count++` → count is increased by one                                      |
| `--`     | Decrements the value of a variable by one: `count--` → count is decreased by one                                      |

> 💡 The precedence of each assignment operator is 2.

</details>

<a name="Type-Conversion"></a>

## Type Conversion

<details>
When you use an operator with a variable with an unfitting type, javascript will automatically
convert this variable into a fitting type. For example:

```js
4 / "2" → 4 / 2
```

There is no "/" operator for strings, so JavaScript converts the string into a number if possible.
This is also true for boolean operators which we will cover in a later session.

> ❗️ There is another `+` operator in JavaScript, that links two strings together: "a" + "b" →
> "ab". When 'adding' a number and a string, the number is converted to a string: "a" + 6 → "a6".
> Make sure that both variables are numbers if you want to add them.

</details>

<a name="Number-Systems"></a>

## Number Systems

<details>
When working with computers, it is sometimes useful to work with a different number system than the
standard 10 digit system, since a computer only understands `binary` numbers composed of only 0
and 1. You don't have to learn these systems by heart, but it is good if you heard about them.

- `decimal system`: the standard numbers, has 10 symbols "0" to "9".
- `binary system`: only has 2 symbols "0" and "1". If you want to write a bigger number than 1, you
  add another digit: 2 → "10" in binary.
- `hexadecimal system`: has 16 symbols "0" to "9" and "a" to "f". If you want to write a number
bigger than 15 you add another digit: 12 → "c" in hexadecimal.

# JS Conditions and Booleans

## Learning Objectives

- using conditions to control the program flow
- understanding what booleans and truthy/falsy values are
- working with comparison and logical operators
- writing ternary expressions

---

<a name="Boolean-Values"></a>

## Boolean Values

<details>
A boolean value, named after George Boole, only has two states. It can either be **true** or
**false**. Booleans are often used in conditional statements which can execute different code
depending on their value.
</details>

<a name="Truthy-and-Falsy-Values"></a>

## Truthy and Falsy Values

<details>
Sometimes you want to have a condition depending on another type of value. JavaScript can transform
any value into a boolean with _type coercion_. That means that some values act as if they were true
and others as if they were false: _Truthy_ values become true, _falsy_ values become false.

- _truthy_ values:

  - non zero numbers: `1`, `2`, `-3`, etc.
  - non empty strings: `"hello"`
  - `true`

- _falsy_ values:
  - `0` / `-0`
  - `null`
  - `false`
  - `undefined`
  - empty string: `""`

</details>

<a name="Comparison-Operators"></a>

## Comparison Operators

<details>
Comparison operators produce boolean values by comparing two expressions:

| Operator  | Effect                                                                           |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A `===` B | strict equal: is `true` if both values are equal (including their type).         |
| A `!==` B | strict not equal: is `true` if both values are not equal (including their type). |
| A `>` B   | strictly greater than: is `true` if A is greater than B.                         |
| A `<` B   | strictly less than: is `true` if A is less than B.                               |
| A `>=` B  | greater than or equal: is `true` if A is greater than or equal B.                |
| A `<=` B  | less than or equal: is `true` if A is less than or equal B.                      |

> 💡 You might notice that JavaScript uses three equal signs (`===`) to check for equality. This can
> seem very strange at first.
>
> - `=` (`const x = 0`) is the assignment operator and has nothing to do with comparison.
> - `==` and `!=` are non-strict equality operators. You should **avoid them 99% of the time**.  
>   Non-strict equality tries to use type coercion to convert both values to the same type:
>   `"3" == 3` is `true`, which is seldomly what you want.
> - `===` and `!==` are strict equality operators. **This is what you need almost always**.  
>   Strict equality checks if type _and_ value are the same: `"3" === 3` is `false`.

</details>

<a name="Logical-Operators"></a>

## Logical Operators

<details>
Logical operators combine up to two booleans into a new boolean.

| Operator                      | Effect                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `!`A                          | `not`: flips a `true` value to `false` and vice versa. |
| A <code>&#124;&#124;</code> B | `or`: is `true` if either A `or` B is true.            |
| A `&&` B                      | `and`: is `true` if both A `and` B is true.            |

> 💡 You can combine logical operators with brackets to define which operator should be evaluated
> first, e.g:
>
> - `(A || B) && (C || D)`
> - `!(A || B)`
>   💡 Be careful when using `&&` or `||` with non-boolean values. They actually return one of the
>   original values. That can be useful, but can also quickly lead to confusion. This behaviour is
>   called
>   [short-circut evaluation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND#short-circuit_evaluation)
>   and is a more advanced topic.
>
> - `"some string" || "some other string"` evaluates to `"some string"`
> - `0 || 100` evaluates to `100`
> - `null && "yet another string"` evaluates to `null`

</details>

<a name="Control-Flow-if-else"></a>

## Control Flow: `if / else`

<details>
With an if statement we can control whether a part of our code is executed or not, based on a
condition.

```js
const isSunShining = true;
if (isSunShining) {
  // code that is executed only if condition "isSunShining" is true
}
```

The else block is executed only if the condition is `false`.

```js
const isSunShining = false;
if (isSunShining) {
  // code that is executed only if condition "isSunShining" is true
} else {
  // code that is executed only if condition "isSunShining" is false
}
```

The condition expression between the `()` brackets can be composed of logical or comparison
operators as well. You can distinguish between more cases by chaining `else if` statements:

```js
if (hour < 12) {
  console.log("Good Morning.");
} else if (hour < 18) {
  console.log("Good afternoon.");
} else if (hour === 24) {
  console.log("Good night.");
} else {
  console.log("Good evening.");
}
```

If the condition is not a boolean, it is converted into one by type coercion. This can be used to
check whether a value is not 0 or an empty string:

```js
const name = "Alex";
if (name) {
  console.log("Hi " + name + "!"); // only executed if name is not an empty string
}
```

</details>

<a name="Ternary-Operator"></a>

## Ternary Operator: `? :`

<details>
With if / else statements whole blocks of code can be controlled. The ternary operator can be used
if you want to decide between two _expressions_, e.g. which value should be stored in a variable:

```js
const greetingText = time < 12 ? "Good morning." : "Good afternoon.";
```

The ternary operator has the following structure:

```js
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```

If the condition is true, the first expression is evaluated, otherwise the second expression. The
ternary operator can be used to decide which function should be called:

```js
isUserLoggedIn ? logoutUser() : loginUser();
```

It can also distinguish which value should be passed as an argument to a function:

```js
moveElement(xPos > 300 ? 300 : xPos); // the element can't be moved further than 300.
```

> ❗️ The operator can only distinguish between two _expressions_ like values, math / logical
> operations or function calls, not between _statements_ like variable declarations, if / else
> statements or multi-line code blocks.

## Advanced: The strangeness of boolean coercion and making use of non-strict equality

<details>
<summary>🫣 This is an advanced topic and not important for the challenges. Click to expand if you're curious.</summary>

Assume you want to check if a variable has a useful value for us to work with. `if(variable)` does
in fact not check if `variable` is defined but rather if it is truthy. Take a look at these
examples:

- `if(undefined)` → falsy, won't execute
- `if(null)` → falsy, won't execute
- `if("")` → falsy, won't execute, but might still be a useful variable  
  (e.g. when user clears an input field)
- `if(0)` → falsy, won't execute, but might still be a useful variable  
  (e.g. when user wants to set the volume to `0`)
- `if(" ")` → truthy, will execute
- `if(-1)` → truthy, will execute

It's useful to define a variable as not having a value when it's `undefined` or `null`. We can check
for that like this:

```js
if (variable != null) {
  console.log('This will be logged even if variable is 0 or ""');
}
```

This is one of the rare valid use cases for non-strict comparison (`!=` instead of `!==`).

JavaScript tries to coerce the compared values into the same type. And just like `"3" == 3` is
`true`, `undefined == null` is also `true`. This also works with `!=` instead of `==`.

> ⚠️ Remember that this is an exception for using non-strict equality. **Strict equality should
> otherwise always be preferred.**
